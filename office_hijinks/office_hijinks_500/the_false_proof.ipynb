    " On one hand you are asked to complete `circuit` (you only need to apply gates).\n",
    " On the other hand you must complete `process_output`, which will take the output of `circuit` (a vector of dimension two where each term can take the value 0 or 1) and will return 2 if $U = RY(2\\pi/3)$ or 4 if $U = RY(4\\pi/3).$\n",

    " \n",
    " The circuit function will receive the gate $U$ that you are asked to determine. To judge whether your circuit works as expected, we will randomly send 5000 different examples and check that they always classified correctly. Therefore, in this question there are no public or private test cases. They are randomly generated.\n",
